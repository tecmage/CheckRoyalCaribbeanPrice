# CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice
Checks if you have the cheapest price for your **Royal Caribbean** and **Celebrity Cruises** purchases (beverage packages, excursions, internet, etc.).  
- ✅ Automatically checks your purchased packages (no need to enter them manually)  
- ✅ Alerts you if a lower price is available (email, ntfy, Home Assistant, etc) 
- ✅ Finds deals specific to each passenger (loyalty or casino status, age-based or room specials) where other "royal price trackers" only find publicly available (often higher) prices
- ✅ Shows currently assigned cabin in Royal's backend system (*likely* the room you will get if purchased a GTY "We choose your room")
- ✅ Shows the payment balance Royal's backend system thinks they are owed (does not include TA's take!) and estimated final payment date
- ✅ Supports multiple Royal and Celebrity accounts or linked cruises
- ✅ Handles all currencies (checks each item based on the currency used to purchase it)
- ✅ Can automatically check **cabin prices** for any cruise you booked, using loyalty/senior/resident discounts
- ✅ Can create a "watchlist" to check prices of items you have not purchased (thanks @jhedlund)  
- ✅ Can also watchlist **cabin prices** with just a booking URL (no login required, supports discounts)  
- ✅ Can display active sitewide promotions (flash sales, percentage-off deals) for each sailing
- ✅ Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Docker, iOS, Android, and Home Assistant. Also a vibe-coded Android App and Greasemonkey script
- ✅ Completely open source, free to use or modify.
- ✅ Separate `BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` script lets you look up any cruise's addon prices, cabin prices, onboard activity schedule, MDR menus, and dress codes. No setup/account required! Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Docker, iOS, Android. Also made a vibe-coded Android App and a Web-based version.
   

> ⚠️ This is **not a hack**. All API calls and data are publicly available. The script simply automates what you can do on the Royal Caribbean website.

7. Optional: For advanced users, you can compile the .exe yourself (because you do not trust files from the internet) with: `pyinstaller -F --collect-all apprise CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` 

## Install (MacOS Option) - Python Not Required!
1. Download [CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_arm64](https://github.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice/releases/latest/download/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_arm64) or [CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_intel](https://github.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice/releases/latest/download/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_intel) depending on your Mac hardware. arm64 = Silicon
1. We must now disable MacOS security for downloaded executables that are not signed.
1. Open a terminal (Command + Spacebar, type Terminal, and press Return)
1. Type `cd Downloads`
1. Type `chmod 755 CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_intel` or `chmod 755 CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_arm64` depending on your architecture
1. Open Finder. Go to Downloads
1. Click `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_intel` or `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_arm64`
1. A malware warning will pop up. Click "Done" (Not "Move to Trash")

1. Open Finder and click `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_intel` or `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_arm64`
   - Note: If no config file is found, code will ask to download a simple config file for you and name it correctly. type "y" and hit enter to download
1. The file will be saved in the root of your home directory, not in the current directory
1. Open Finder. Go To Menu Bar and click Go->Home
1. Edit downloaded config.yaml with your user/password. Do not change the spacing before the `-` lines. `#` means comment and everything to the right will be ignored
1. The downloaded configuration file will log the output to "output.txt" in your Home folder, this avoids requiring to keep the output on screen.
1. Click `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_intel` or `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS_arm64`
1. After confirmed working, you can add more options into `config.yaml`! I do not know how to automatically run this every X hours on a Mac, maybe someone will post directions.
1. If you download a new version, you will need to do the `chmod` and "Click Open Anyway" steps again.

## Install (Recommended Option, any Operating System Windows/Linux/Mac, and you can edit code to your liking)
1. Install python3 (3.12 works fine) `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
1. Download the [CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice/refs/heads/main/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py) from this repo or `git clone https://github.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.git`
1. `pip install requests Apprise`

## Install (Greasemonkey script, runs in your browser, no Python needed)
This only runs cruise addon price checking (no notifcation or cabin price checking). Coded with AI, so be warned. Only tested on Windows Firefox and iOS using userscripts extension for Safari and Gear Browser. 

1. Install Greasemonkey/TamperMonkey Extension for your specific browser. Follow only step 1 at: [https://greasyfork.org](https://greasyfork.org)
   - For iOS, recommend installing the free Gear Browser option in link above. Much easier to get working than the userscripts extension. The paid TamperMonkey options have not been tested.
1. Once browser or browser extension installed, click [this](https://github.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice/raw/refs/heads/main/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.user.js) link to install userscript from this repo. If using iOS Gear Browser, must click in that browser.
1. Log into Royal/Celebrity website in browser with extension installed
1. Click "Price Check" button that now appears at bottom right of page when logged into Royal Caribbean website.
1. You need to watch the logs for any price drops
  
## Install (iOS / iPhone)
iOS can run a stripped down version or an almost full version that supports everything except apprise! Stripped down version is a little easier to setup, but setup must be repeated if code needs an upgrade. Full version is harder to setup, but much simpler to upgrade.

### Stripped down version
This will run a stripped down version to work on the free Python iPhone app. It is a little easier to setup, but need to repeat setup if a new version comes out.
As stripped down, it only supports excursion/drink packages etc. It does not support cruise fare price checks. It does not support apprise notifications, so you will have to watch the log to see any price drops. You need to edit the python file directly (directions below) because it does not use the config.yaml file. But allows you to check prices on the go. Works on the ship even *without* the internet package!

1. Install Python on your Phone
   - iOS: Get Python From Appstore. `https://apps.apple.com/us/app/python-coding-editor-ide-app/id6444399635`
      - Free version is fine, no need to make inapp purchases.
3. Download `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice/refs/heads/main/PhonePriceCheck.py` from the repo to your computer
   -   Use a text editor to add your username and password between the "" a few lines down.
   -   If you are are using a Celebrity account, remove `#` before `#cruiseLineName = "celebritycruises"`
   -   Ignore the `Edit Config File` section below, that only pretains to computer installations
4. Email yourself the edited `PhonePriceCheck.py`
   -   On your iPhone, save the emailed `PhonePriceCheck.py` to your files section. This can be done by clicking the attachment, select share, then select saved files
5. Open Python App (these are iOS instructions, need to modify for Android)
   -    Tap the **blue** hamburger icon on the top right side of the screen, just below the adverstisement
   -    Tap "Load from File"
   -    Select the PhonePriceCheck.py file you downloaded
   -    To run: tap the arrow icon at top right of screen (between a bug icon and a `...` icon)
6. Look for any price drops in the output

### Full Version (almost!)
This will run the standard python code. It does not support apprise notifications. You will have to watch the log to see any price drops or look at the log file. Allows you to check prices on the go. Works on the ship even *without* the internet package!

1. Install Python on your Phone
   - iOS: Get Python From Appstore. `https://apps.apple.com/us/app/python-coding-editor-ide-app/id6444399635`
      - Free version is fine, no need to make inapp purchases.
3. Download `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice/refs/heads/main/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` from the repo to your computer or direct to your phone
4. If download on computer, email yourself the edited `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py`
   -   On your iPhone, save the emailed `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` to your files section in Download Folder. This can be done by clicking the attachment, select share, then select saved files
5. Open Python App (these are iOS instructions, need to modify for Android)
   -    Tap the **blue** hamburger icon on the top right side of the screen, just below the adverstisement
   -    Tap "Load from File"
   -    Select the CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py file you downloaded
   -    To run: tap the arrow icon at top right of screen (between a bug icon and a `...` icon)
   -    Type `y` to download the baseline config, it will to "On My Iphone/Python CodePad"
   -    Click blue hamburger icon, "Load From File" and navigate to "On My Iphone/Python CodePad" and config.yaml
   -    Edit this file with your username/password and any other settings besides `apprise:` (code will crash if you have `apprise` in your config)
   -    Click Save. You can also probably move your normal config.yaml via iTunes if you wish.
   -    Here is tricky part, the above step saved config.yaml as config.py
   -    Open iPhone Files App. Navigate to "On My Iphone/Python CodePad". Delete config.yaml. Click config.py and rename to config.yaml. Confirm you want to change name to .yaml
   -    Go back to Python App, Open CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py, and run
   -    You can use the file app to open output.txt if you want to review what happened.
   -    The config file never needs to be touched again.
6. Look for any price drops in the output
   
## Install (Android)
Android users have option of running a stripped down vibe-coded native app, or stripped down python or full version python (python is not vibe-coded).  Stripped down python version only supports excursion/drink packages etc. You need to edit the python file directly (directions below) because it does not use the config.yaml file. Full version supports everything. Both options allow you to check prices on the go. Works on the ship even *without* the internet package!

### Native Android App (Stripped Down & Vibe Coded with Claude to convert from python code)
1. Install the [APK](https://github.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice/releases/download/3.3.1/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.apk) on your Android phone or Fire Tablet.
1. Start it, allow notifications.
1. Click "Go to Settings" and enter you Royal Caribbean account credentials.
1. Back out of settings, then click "Run Check" button at bottom right.
1. As stripped down, it does not handle Apprise notifcations or automatic check cabin prices. It will notify via Android and do manual cabin price checks from a URL.
1. If you get the cruise URL on your phone, when you change an addon (like gratituies, insurance, refundable deposit) do a reload of page from the menu to pull in new URL or code may only find the price without addons.
1. May have problems with password with special characters (most of debugging was to fix this!)
1. As vibe-coded, it will not be updated much
1. The "Enable Auto Check" feature has not been tested.
1. If the app crashes after upgrading, delete the data and cache in your android settings menu for the app.

## Install (Home Assistant Addon/App Option)
See directions at: https://github.com/jdeath/homeassistant-addons/tree/main/royalpricecheck

## Install (Docker Option - thanks @JDare)

### Single Execution (One-time price check)
For a single price check without scheduling:
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro \
  ghcr.io/jdeath/checkroyalcaribbeanprice:latest \
  check
```

### Scheduled Execution
#### Option 1: Using Pre-built Image
1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
services:
  cruise-price-checker:
    image: ghcr.io/jdeath/checkroyalcaribbeanprice:latest
    container_name: cruise-price-checker
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Timezone for cron execution (default: UTC)
      # Examples: America/New_York, America/Chicago, America/Los_Angeles, Europe/London
      # Full list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
      - TZ=America/New_York
      # Cron schedule: 7 AM and 7 PM daily in the specified timezone
      - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 7,19 * * *
    volumes:
      # Mount your config file
      - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```
2. Create your `config.yaml` file (see "Edit Config File" section below)
3. Run: `docker compose up -d`

#### Option 2: Build from Source
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.git`
2. `cd CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice`
3. Create your `config.yaml` file (see "Edit Config File" section below)
4. Run: `docker compose up -d`

The Docker container will run the price checker on the schedule you have defined.

## Edit Config File
If a config file is not found, code will prompt if you want it to automatically download a simple config file.

Create your `config.yaml` file with the below information. Feel free to copy the file `SAMPLE-config.yaml` to `config.yaml`. Edit `config.yaml` and place it in same directory as `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` or `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.exe` or when running `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` provide the optional argument `-c path/to/config.yaml`. The spacing/alignment is important. (eg. The `-` under accountInfo must be 3 spaces over under the 2nd c in account).  
```yaml
accountInfo:
  - username: "user@gmail.com" # Your Royal Caribbean User Name
    password: "pa$$word" # Your Royal Caribbean Password
  - username: "user@gmail.com" # Your Celebrity User Name
    password: "pa$$word" # Your Celebrity Password
    cruiseLine: "celebrity" # Must indicate if celebrity
displayCruisePrices: true # Optional, this will display current price for your booked cruises. Use above discount codes.
minimumSavingAlert: 0.00 # Optional, only alert when savings are >= this amount (per-night/per-day items use total savings per item)
notifyOnError: false # Optional, send Apprise alert if the script fails (default: false)
cruises: # Optional, this allows you to watch the price of a cruise you have not booked yet
  - cruiseURL: "https://www.royalcaribbean.com/checkout/guest-info?sailDate=2025-12-27&shipCode=VI&groupId=VI12BWI-753707406&packageCode=VI12L049&selectedCurrencyCode=USD&country=USA&cabinClassType=OUTSIDE&roomIndex=0&r0a=2&r0c=0&r0b=n&r0r=n&r0s=n&r0q=n&r0t=n&r0d=OUTSIDE&r0D=y&rgVisited=true&r0C=y&r0e=N&r0f=4N&r0g=BESTRATE&r0h=n&r0j=2138&r0w=2&r0B=BD&r0x=AF&r0y=6aa01639-c2d8-4d52-b850-e11c5ecf7146"
    paidPrice: "3833.74"
  - cruiseURL: "https://www.celebritycruises.com/checkout/guest-info?groupId=RF04FLL-1098868345&packageCode=RF4BH246&sailDate=2025-08-11&country=USA&selectedCurrencyCode=USD&shipCode=RF&cabinClassType=INTERIOR&category=I&roomIndex=0&r0a=2&r0c=0&r0b=n&r0r=n&r0s=n&r0q=n&r0t=n&r0d=OUTSIDE&r0D=y&rgVisited=true&r0C=y&r0e=Y&r0f=Y&r0g=BESTRATE&r0h=n&r0A=1127.6" # Can have as many URLS and price paid as you want. Supports Celebrity too
    paidPrice: "1127.6"
apprise_test: false # Optional

  - url: "mailto://user:password@gmail.com"
  - url: "ntfy://abcfeg3839439djd"
logFile: "output.txt"
```

If you only want to check cruise addons (drink packages, excursions, etc) and do not want emails or check cruise prices, the config file is simpler. Start with this to see if works. You can have any number of Royal and/or Celebrity accounts:
```yaml
accountInfo:
  - username: "user@gmail.com" # Your Royal Caribbean User Name
    password: "pa$$word" # Your Royal Caribbean Password
    cruiseLine: "royal" # or "celebrity", This is optional and defaults to royal if not present
```

To log your output to a file, add the LogFile: line and change "output.txt" to whatever you want. If you do not want logging, remove the line
```yaml
accountInfo:
  - username: "user@gmail.com" # Your Royal Caribbean User Name
    password: "pa$$word" # Your Royal Caribbean Password
    cruiseLine: "royal" # or "celebrity", This is optional and defaults to royal if not present
logFile: "output.txt"
```

To display current cabin prices for your **booked** cruise(s), set displayCruisePrices to true. This will request the current price from Royal's website. The code automatically determines the number of adults and children from your booking. If you are Diamond Plus 340+ on a solo booking, it will automatically apply. It will find any publically offered OBC and display it (but not subtract it because it is only given in USD). The script will tell you if the cabin class (Interior, Balcony, Connecting Balcony, etc) you booked is no longer for sale, which means you cannot reprice. The script will also tell you if you are beyond the final payment date (75-120 days before departure depending on length of cruise), which also means you cannot reprice. If you need any special fares or discounts, see below section to compare to the price you paid.
```yaml
accountInfo:
  - username: "user@gmail.com" # Your Royal Caribbean User Name
    password: "pa$$word" # Your Royal Caribbean Password
    cruiseLine: "royal" or "celebrity" # This is optional and defaults to royal (note the L is capitalized)
displayCruisePrices: true
```

**Note: This paragraph is for versions <= 3.2.1 . If using python in repository, use next paragraph:**

**Note: Updated code will still mostly allow this format above...for now**

**Note: Updated code will support the old price format, but not support the IGRA qualifiers. Update format as described in next section**

If you want to compare cabin prices for your **booked** cruise(s), include the following info in your config, where XXXXXX and YYYYY are your reservation ID. The price can only have a `.` or `,` for the decimal place, do not use an indicator for thousands place. You must provide the price you paid as is not possible to look up via the API. Enter the price paid including taxes and subtract any OBC you received. The code will identify if new booking has OBC and display it (but not subtract it since always give in USD). If you booked with a refundable deposit, put an R before the Price (R1999.98). If you booked with included gratitues, put a G in front of the price (G1999.99). If Celebrity with All-In price put an A (A1999.99). If you booked with trip insurance, put an I in front of price (I1999.99). You can use any or all combinations (GIRA1999.99). This will cause the code to request the correct price from the API.

If price is lower and before the final payment date (even if you paid in full), do a mock booking on the website to confirm then call your travel agent. 
```yaml
accountInfo:
  - username: "user@gmail.com" # Your Royal Caribbean User Name
    password: "pa$$word" # Your Royal Caribbean Password 
    cruiseLine: "royal" or "celebrity" # This is optional and defaults to royal
displayCruisePrices: true
reservationPricePaid:
  'XXXXXX': 4568.48
  'YYYYYY': R4172.71

**Note: Old code will not allow this new format**

If you want to compare cabin prices for your **booked** cruise(s), include the following info in your config, where XXXXXX and YYYYY are your reservation ID. The price can only have a `.` or `,` for the decimal place, do not use an indicator for thousands place. You must provide the price you paid as is not possible to look up via the API. Enter the price paid including taxes and subtract any OBC you received. The code will identify if new booking has OBC and display it (but not subtract it since always give in USD). If you booked a special fare, you must set the corresponding keys. You only need to set what you need, will default to false. If you booked with a refundable deposit, set `refundable = true`. If you booked with included gratitues, set `gratuities=true`. If Celebrity with All-In price, set `allInUpgrade=true`. If you booked with trip insurance, set `tripInsurance=true`. All of the others keys are optional, if you do not set them they default to false or will use the information (state, loyalty number, etc) from your account. This will let the code to request the correct price from the API. Note some GTY rooms do not have the proper information set in your account. You may need to override the category codes, the code will print an error message if this applies to you. Post an issue if you need help.

    paidPrice: "3833.74"
```

If you would like to assign names to cruise reservation numbers to more easily correlate which cruise is being displayed populate the following section:
```yaml
reservationFriendlyNames:
  '1234567': "Summer Cruise"
  '8912345': "Winter Cruise
```

To override the system's default date format, set the dateDisplayFormat config value to your desired format:
```yaml
dateDisplayFormat: "%m/%d/%Y"
```

To override the currency from what the API returns (what you bought the item in), set the currencyOverride config value to your desired currencyOverride. This should not be needed and should now only be needed for testing.
```yaml
currencyOverride: 'DKK'
```

To only alert when a price drop meets a minimum savings threshold, set minimumSavingAlert. For items priced per night/per day, the threshold compares against the total savings per item across the cruise. Use case is prices change fluctuate and not worth it to you for cance/rebook. If not set or set to 0.00, alerts trigger on any price drop as before.
```yaml
minimumSavingAlert: 2.00
```

To get an alert if the script fails to run (crash, bad config, network error, etc), set notifyOnError. This sends a short Apprise notification and exits with a non-zero code so schedulers can detect the failure. If not set or set to false, failures only show in the console/log.
```yaml
notifyOnError: true
```

To display active sitewide promotions (flash sales, percentage-off deals) for each of your sailings, set showPromos to true. This queries the Royal Caribbean promotions API and shows any current deals with their discount, valid dates, and countdown timers.
```yaml
showPromos: true
```


## Get Cruise URL for Watchlist Functionality (Optional - This is only for a cruise you have not booked!)
1. If you want to check the cabin price of a cruise you have booked, see above. This section is just for cruises you have *not* booked yet.
1. Be sure you are logged out of the Royal Caribbean / Celebrity Website. If you are logged in, the URL you get in Step 5 will not work.
1. Go to Royal Caribbean or Celebrity and do a mock booking of the room you want, with the same number of adults and kids
1. Select a cruise and select your room type/room. Be sure to enter your C&A number and any senior/military/police discounts in the "Apply Promo Code and Exclusive Rates" link to the left. **Use your C&A or Celebrity # depending on the cruise. Do not use username. Bug in Royal Website requires your number not username**
1. If you want a refundable deposit, trip insurance, included gratituies, or Celebrity only All-In package be sure to select them on the "preferences screen"
1. If you have a coupon code (e.g dp340 for Diamond Plus 340+ on a solo booking), be sure to enter it.
1. Complete until they ask for your personal/guest information
1. At this point, you should see a blue bar at the bottom right of webpage with a price
1. Copy the entire URL from the top of your browser into the cruiseURL field. The url should start with `https://www.royalcaribbean.com/checkout/guest-info?...` or `https://www.celebritycruises.com/checkout/guest-info?...` where `...` is a bunch of stuff. Copy the entire URL
1. Put the price you paid in the paidPrice field. Remove the `$` and any `,` . Subtract any OBC you recieved from Royal or your TA. Do not add letters in this price, the code can tell from the URL if you included gratities, All-In package, etc.
1. Run the tool and see if it works
1. You can add multiple cruiseURL/paidPrice to track multiple cruises or rooms on a cruise
1. If the code says the price is cheaper, do a mock booking to see if cabin is still available. You need to do this from a new search on the Royal Caribbean / Celebrity website. Do not just put the cruiseURL in your browser.
1. If it is lower than you paid for and before final payment date call your Travel Agent or Royal Caribbean (if you booked direct) and they should (reports of pushback lately) reduce the price. Be careful, you will lose the onboard credit you got in your first booking, if the new booking does not still offer it! The code will print the OBC offered for the new cruise, but will not subtract it because OBC only given in USD
1. Update the pricePaid field to the new price. Remove the `$` ,`£` and any `,` (or `.` if non-USD currency for thousands designator)
1. If there are no more rooms of the same class available to book, you will not be able to reprice. You will need to wait until a room opens up. The code will print the cheapest interior, outside view, balcony or suite available. These are probably GTY for each class and not the exact type of room you wanted. This is all the public cruise price API returns.
1. If you only want to check the cruise prices with URL you provide, you do not need to have your `accountInfo` and/or `apprise` in your config file, as they are not necessary.
1. Should always give price in your current currency (except for OBC which is only in USD). If your currency is not supported, create an issue
   
## Watch List for Beverage Packages/Excursions/etc (Optional)
The watch list feature allows you to monitor specific cruise add-ons for price drops across all your bookings. When enabled, the system will check each passenger individually for the specified items and alert you if prices drop below your target price.

### Configuration
Add a `watchList` section to your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
watchList: # Optional, items to monitor for price drops across all your bookings
  - name: "Deluxe Beverage Package"
    prefix: "pt_beverage"  # Category prefix
    product: "3005"        # Product ID
    price: 85.00           # Alert if current price drops below this amount. Use per night w/o gratutity price
    enabled: true          # Set to false to temporarily disable this item
    currency: "GBP"        # Optional currency code, defaults to "USD" if not set
    guestAgeString: "child" # "infant", "child", "adult" are only options. Optional, defaults to "adult" if not set.
    reservations: ['XXXXXXX', 'YYYYYYY'] # Optional. Check watchlist only for these reservation numbers. If not present, defaults to check all reservations   
  - name: "Premium WiFi 2 Device Package"
    prefix: "pt_internet"
    product: "33F1"
    price: 30.00
    enabled: false         # This item will be skipped
```

### How It Works
- **Per-Passenger Checking**: Each watchlist item is checked individually for every passenger in your bookings
- **Individual Pricing**: Passengers may have different pricing based on loyalty status, age, or room category
- **Output Format**: Results show as `[WATCH] Item Name - Passenger (Room): Message`
- **Enabled Control**: Use the `enabled` field to temporarily disable specific watchlist items without removing them

### Finding Product Information
To find the `prefix` and `product` values for items you want to watch:
1. Go to your Cruise Planner website and browse to the package you want to watch
1. Inspect the URL to find the `prefix` and `product`, for example for the Premium WIFI 2 Device Package the URL looks like:
   `https://www.celebritycruises.com/account/cruise-planner/category/pt_internet/product/33F1?bookingId=&shipCode=&sailDate=`
1. The `prefix` is the path following /category/ (`pt_internet` in this case)
1. The `product` is the value following /product/ (`33F1` in this case)
1. Use the advertised price in the cruise panner. Eg. Do not include gratituty. Use per day price for Beverage Package, UDP, Internet, Key.
1. You can also run the `BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` with the `-w` flag to print the watchlist codes for every item in a cruise.
1. Note: product numbers can be different on different cruises: Eg. Royal Deluxe Beverage package can be 3222 or 3224

### Example Output
```
[WATCH] Deluxe Beverage Package - John (1234): Book! Deluxe Beverage Package Price is lower: 75.00 than 85.00
[WATCH] Internet Package - Mary (1234): price is higher than watch price: 25.00 (now 30.00)
```

## Notification Emails/Pushbullet/etc via Apprise (Optional)
1. Review documentation for apprise at: https://github.com/caronc/apprise
1. 99% of people probably have gmail, so you can use the default already setup in the sample config.yaml
1. This will send you an email only if there is a price drop
1. Change username to your gmail username
1. Change password to your gmail password. If you use 2-factor authentication, you need to generate an app password. You cannot use use normal password
   - Documentation to generate an app password for gmail is here: https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords
1. You can delete the whatsapp line, that is included so you know how to add other services. You can also add more lines for an additional gmail accounts.
1. To test apprise, add a key in your config.yaml that says `apprise_test: true` . This will send a notification, then quit and not run the price check. This key goes above the `apprise:` keys not inside it (see `Edit Config File` section above). Once you know apprise is working, remove the line or set value to `false`
1. To be alerted if the script fails to run, set `notifyOnError: true` in your `config.yaml`. This sends a short Apprise notification and the script exits with a non-zero code.

## Run
1. `python CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` (recommended, any OS) or `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.exe` (Windows only)
    - It will indicate if you should rebook or if you have the best price
    - It will also tell you if the price has gone up since you purchased (do not rebook in that case!)
    - If you setup apprise, it will notify you via your preferred method(s) if you should rebook
    - Will provide you a link to the order history for that cruise and also tell you the date/order number to cancel from that list
      - Log in to Royal Caribbean on the web browser before clicking the link, or the link will not bring you to the correct location
      - (There does not appear to be a way to construct a Web link to that specific order. If you find one, please let me know via an issue)  
    - After cancelling/modify the order, click the product image to reorder.

## Output
Will output information on your purchases (redacted output below)

```
If any of the prices are lower, it will send a notification if you set up apprise. Notification will include a link to your order history and the specific date and order number to cancel. Notice on the 2nd reservation, the official room is GTY but the excursions show the currently assigned room in the Royal backend system. This room is likely what you will get!

## Automating
1. Linux: Put in a cron job, if running in linux, I am sure you know how! Be sure to either provide optional argument for the `config.yaml` path or be sure to execute the script from within the directory where the configuration script is present.
1. Home Assistant: Use directions in my [repo](https://github.com/jdeath/homeassistant-addons/tree/main/royalpricecheck)
1. Docker: See directions in docker section above
1. Windows: Use windows task schedular
    1. Type "task schedular" in Windows search bar to bring up program (icon is a clock with 12-3 o'clock shadded)
    1. Create a basic task (Action Menu->Create Basic Task)
    1. Select a daily trigger, suggest a little before you wake up
    1. Action, select "Start a Program"
    1. In "Program/script" Select the CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.exe file you download from here. Make sure the config.yaml is in same directory as .exe (if running python script, should be able to put python.exe the full path of this the script location)
    1. In "Start in (optional)" enter the directory of the .exe/.yaml (you can copy the "Program/script" field, paste it, and remove the CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.exe)
    1. After clicking finish, you can right click on task, go to triggers, and add more times to trigger the script. Suggest a time right before you get home from work. Twice a day should be sufficient
    1. Ensure apprise notifications are working, because the window will close automatically after run.

## Other Notes
**Want to monitor a friend's cruise?** You can either link their cruise to your account or add their account the `config.yaml` account list. 

On the Royal Website, you need their reservation number, name, and birthdate to link the cruise to your account (select my name is not listed). Then this code will check their packages which avoids needing their username/password. For linked reservations, the passenger may appear to be in the wrong room. This is just a feature of the code which I cannot seem to fix. The correct passengers' first names booked in each room will be shown for each booking. If the item was purchased by someone besides the account being used to check the price, the email will notify you that someone else must cancel/rebook. The code cannot tell you who actually booked it. Note, linked reservations can be confusing to cancel/rebook. If the Royal App/Website says you cannot cancel the reservation because you did not make it, you need to try all combonations. For instance, try looking at the orders on your account on "My Cruise" and also the orders on your account but on "Linked Cruise". If the other person you are linked to actually bought it, they will have to try both My Cruise and Linked Cruise.

If you have their username/password, you can add it to the list of accounts in the config.yaml and it will cycle though accounts automatically.

**Do you have a GTY Room and want to know the room you will likely get?** If a room is not officially assigned yet, the code displays GTY (meaning guarantee) for your room number. However, any excursion purchased will show the passenger's name and the room number currently associated with that excursion. Guess what? That room number is likely the room you will be officially assigned. Confirmed by the author, please post an issue if you can confirm this as well.

**Are you browsing the website for the best prices?** Always add the item to your cart and then go to the next page where you enter your credit card. Often the price will be lower in the screen where you enter your credit card then in your cart. If on the fence, do the extra step and you may be suprised!

# Issues
1. ~~Will not work if your password has an % in it. Change your password (replace % with ! for instance).~~ Fixed in > 3.0.1
1. OBC will display in USD even if cruise being checked in a different currency. Not fixable as this is how OBC is provided
1. Please double check that the price is lower before you rebook! I am not responsible if you book at a higher price!
1. Double check you are cancelling the item for the correct cruise

# Browse RoyalCaribbean Prices
This will browse any Royal Caribbean or Celebrity sailing and display current public prices for **every** excursion/drink package/dinning package sold on a cruise. If you book the cruise, the price could be lower than shown due to C&A or casino specials.  It will provide a link to the Royal Caribbean or Celebrity website which has the product prices for that cruise (be sure to be logged out of the website or link will not work). It will  print any scheduled activities for the cruise, such as trivia and gameshows and theme nights. It will also print the current price of cheapest room in each category (inside, oceanview, balcony, suite). It will print MDR menus. This program does **not** require a configuration file nor a Royal Caribbean/Celebrity account. Inspired by and similar functionality to `https://cruisespotlight.com/royal-caribbean-cruise-planner-price-lookup/` website.

Vibe Coded (Claude) Android (or Fire Tablet) App [Android APK](https://github.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice/releases/download/3.3.1/BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.apk) . This is nice because can search and change sorting on the fly. Vibe coding just to convert from hand-written python.

You simply run the script. It will prompt you to select the ship and sailing from a menu.
- `python BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` or `BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.exe` or `BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice_MacOS`
-  MacOS users will need to disable the Malware warning as explained in above documentation
-  iOS / Android users can also run the script as is. Download python script and basically follow above iOS/Andriod directions.
-  Android or Amazon Fire Tablet users can also run a vibe-coded native android app: see above
  
Defaults to system defined currency. If you want a different currency, for example DKK:
- `python BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py -c DKK` or  `BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.exe -c DKK`

If you are looking for a specific ship or sail date, you may also specify them on the command line as well.  Some examples are: 
- `python BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py -s Wonder` or `BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.exe -s Wonder`
- `python BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py -d 05/10/2027` or `BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.exe -d 05/10/2027`
  - Please note that you may need to adjust the date format for your particular locale setting (for example, '5/10/2027' insead of '05/10/2027')

You may sort the resulting list per category alphabetically, by price, or using the default order from Royal Caribbean's servers.  Some examples are:
- `python BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py -o alpha` or `python BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py -o price`

Command-line options may be used in any combination.  They are:
- -c, --currency: currency (default: System currency) (e.g USD, GBP, DKK or others)
- -s, --ship: The ship to browse for; do not include 'of the Seas' after the ship name (Royal Caribbean) or 'Celebrity' before it (Celebrity)
- -d, --saildate: Date of the sailing to browse for (date format is mm/dd/yy)
- -k, --sortkey: Sort each category alphabetically, by price (lowest to highest), or the default order from the server (default)
- -o, --sortorder: Sort each category in ascending or descending order, based on the sortkey value
- -w, --watchlistcodes: Display the codes for each product to put in `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` product watchlist function (default no display)
- -l, --logfile: Output also saves to file (eg. output.txt)
   
Note: Due to API limiations, `BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` only shows price for the default variant (eg. 1 Wifi device not 2, 12 evian bottles not 24), These items are for sale, but the API does not return price. The `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` script will find the price for these.
There are no plans to add price checking/price history to this script. Use the `CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py` script for that. If you really want to check public prices which may not be representative of the real deal you can get, just use `RoyalPriceTracker.com`.

Cruise activity schedule, such as trivia and game shows, often only populated a few days before the cruise. Look at sailing 0) or 1) in the list to get an idea of current activities on the ship. This is much faster than changing your cruise in the App! Will print MDR menus if available. For Royal, look for the "Dress Code" activity and for Celebrity look for "Tonight's Attire" activity to see the theme nights.

You can run this on the iPhone, following the iPhone install directions and download the [BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdeath/CheckRoyalCaribbeanPrice/refs/heads/main/BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice.py) to your phone, no need to edit as the Browse script does not need username/password.

There is also an EXPIRIMENTAL vibe-coded browser based version of the BrowseRoyalCaribbeanPrice available at `https://jdeath.github.io/` . You must disable CORS in your broweser for it to work.
